### arrays in javascript
>> like python, it can hold values of different types.
>> we can create empty arrays of a specific size by calling the Array class constructor with 'new' keyword.

>> array methods:
-> forEach(value, index) method - goes through all elements of array but cannot return anything.
-> map(value, index) method - same as forEach but can return value as array.
-> filter()  method - returns new array based on condition.
-> sort() method - this is basically a mess. you have to create function for this to pass as an argument for it to do its thing.
-> reduce(accumulator, value) method - we can reduce the whole array into one single value(accumulator) based on an operation.
-> push(value) - appending to array.
-> unshift(value) - first mein jata value.
-> pop() - always last wala udata hai.
-> shift() - pehla udane ke liye.
-> arr1.concat(arr2) - you know how it is.
-> slice(index1, index2) - index1 + next, not index2 in new arrays.
-> indexOf(element) - returns index of the element.
-> lastIndexOf(element) - in case of multiple copies of elements in the array, this returns the index of the same element in the very end.
-> every() - like AND logical operation.
-> some() - like OR logical operation
