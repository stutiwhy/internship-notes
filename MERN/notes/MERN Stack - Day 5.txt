>> array methods:
find(value) - returns the value if it exists in the array

### objects in JS (dictionary)
>> two ways to access object values through keys
-> dot
-> square brackets(need to put key in single quotes)

>> nested objects
-> access value of nested object through dot notation. 

>> even functions can be stored as values in objects.
-> can return function. 
-> can directly call function from outside.

>> Object.keys(obj) - returns all the keys from an object.

>> Object.values(obj) - returns all the values from an object.

>> for of loop does not work directly on objects but if you use it with keys and values methods then it will work.

### string
>> it is a collection of characters.

>> it is ordered.

>> string methods :
-> length()
-> chatAt() - same as box bracket.
-> charCodeAt() - unicode of number and ASCII of alphabets.
-> indexOf(char,start_index) - returns index of char.
-> concat() - string concatenation
-> includes(char, start_index) - checks if a string has the char present in it.
-> split(seperator) : returns separated array.
-> slice()
-> lastIndexOf() - you know how it is.
-> replace(replacee, replacer)
-> trim() - trims unnecessary spaces from start and end.
-> startsWith() 
-> endsWith()
-> repeat()
