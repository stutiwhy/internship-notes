### error
>>> types :
-> compile time error : syntax error.
   easiest to handle.
-> run-time error : divide by zero, file not found.
   hardest to handle.
-> logical error : wrong logic; incorrect output.

>>> how to handle errors
-> try - catch blocks

-> try : risky code
-> catch(object) - what to do (print) after error occurred.
-> object : object.name, object.message

-> throw is raise of JS.
-> throw new ErrorName(message)
-> new keyword is used to make an object of the error.
-> catch(obj)

>>> error class : parent of all errors
-> just put error class in place of ErrorName because whatever.

### user-defined exceptions
>>> how to make
-> extend from Error class
-> constructor(message)
-> super(msg) : super keyword used to borrow logic of printing error message.

### html
>>> link css file using link tag in head
>>> link js file using script tag in body
>>> beside h1 we can write either id or class = bla bla whatever name. using that name we can specifically style that thing.
