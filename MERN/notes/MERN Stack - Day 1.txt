Primitive datatypes in JS:
> Number
> String
> null
> Boolean
> undefined

Non-primitive datatypes in JS:
> Array(welcome back, buddy! you weren't missed at all)
> Objects(similar to dicts in python)

Printing simple stuff

Concatenation

Using assignment operators

null and how it is different than undefined: 
it isn't much but null is apparently a placeholder? and undefined isn't? cool

Using "let" and "var"

Difference between "let" and "var"

"let" is better(usually) because it shows errors instead of giving out undefined

"let" is used only once in the start when initializing
the respective variable can be reassigned a new value without using "let"
if you use it again, you will get error
local/functional scope

"var" is used always everywhere reassignment stuff.
var does not show errors because it is a little b
global scope

i like him

Array stuff:
> Indexing
> Reassigning values
> printing it bla bla

Object:
> it is basically dictionary in JS.
> even syntax is same
> i like it
> values of keys can be arrays 
> values of keys which are arrays can be updates, even index wise

There's a lot of undefined stuff happening here.
JS is very easy going kind of language.
It doesn't recognise many syntactical errors that other programming language would have your ass for.
idhar extra comma, udhar unneeded semi colon. no worries! we don't care!

String methods. variable.toUpperCase()

loose equal to operator :
 == only checks value, not datatype
 === checks with datatype
